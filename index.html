          <h2>Computer Engineering Student</h2>

          <p>Being a detail-oriented Computer Engineering student with and a zest
            for solving complex problems, I am currently studying at NBN
            Sinhgad School of Engineering, and I have been programming for
            about 3 years. I started off with Python, moved on to C/C++, and now
            I'm working with Java. My main interests are in software engineering,
            web and application development and programming.</p>
          <p>Add another paragraph if needed.</p>

            <h3>Architecture and Research Challenges in Blockchain Based Cloud-Computing</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology represents a distributed ledger that maintains a record of all transactions carried out over a network and distributes those details among the nodes involved. Bitcoin is a well-known digital money that is applied using the technology of blockchain. Instead of using the help of a local server, a cloud system uses a network of far-flung servers to store, manage, and analyze data. However, it still faces many challenges including data security, data management, compliance, and reliability. Throughout this paper, we've discussed some of the cloud's most pressing issues and proposed solutions based on blockchain technology integration. In this article, we describe a brief assessment of earlier studies that discussed the integration of blockchain and the cloud. During the study, we also developed a framework to integrate blockchain with the cloud and to demonstrate the communication between the two.</p>
